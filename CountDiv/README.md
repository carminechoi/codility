Write a function:
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>def solution(A, B, K)</tt></p>
that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:
<p>{ i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i&nbsp;<b>mod</b>&nbsp;K = 0 }</p>
For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.
Write an <b><b>efficient</b></b> algorithm for the following assumptions:
<ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>A and B are integers within the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span class="number">2,000,000,000</span>];</li>
<li>K is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span class="number">2,000,000,000</span>];</li>
<li>A ≤ B.</li>
</ul>
